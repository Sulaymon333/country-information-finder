# Developing an interactive Country information finder App

This app is developed as part of my 6 months coding bootcamp at Integrify Helsinki. It is about searching any country information on the list with an on the fly search results. You can either search by sorting the name of the country, by capital city or by population size. I have implemented the project using javaScript and DOM manipulation techniques. All functionalities was completed with ONLY Vanilla JavaScript. Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.
